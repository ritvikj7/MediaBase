# Mediabase
## An application that stores and ranks different forms of media a user may have watched or read—movies, tv-shows, anime, novels, manga, and webtoons—all in one place.

## What will this application do?
This application aims to **store and rank different sorts of media a user has watched or read**—that could 
be movies, tv-shows, anime, novels, manga, or webtoons. Possible features include:
- Multiple categories to differentiate types of media consumed
- An internal ranking system where a user can rank media specifically to the type it is 
- An external ranking system where they can rank all the media they have consumed regardless of type. 
- A synopsis or note section that acts as a reminder as to why they ranked a movie or anime where they initially did
- Fields to store important data such as director/author, year of release/publication, or genre.


## The motivation behind developing this application
My passion for Manhwa inspires the idea behind this project. Manhwas are South Korean comics which have become super popular in the past few years. As I started reading these comics, I found no software or app which could keep track of the comics I have read and rank them according to my preference. Therefore, I have simply used a Google Doc to meet my needs. I further noticed that such apps or websites exist for other popular forms of media such as movies or anime. But the problem with such apps and websites is that they are focused solely on one form of media. For example, on MAL (my anime list) I can only store and rank the anime I have watched; similarly, on IMDB I can only do that for movies. *So my need to have a place to store Manhwa, and my desire to rank different pieces of media regardless of form inspired me to attempt this as my 210 project*. This project can be helpful to many people because we all rely on some form of media whether that be TV, books, music, or comics as a source of entertainment, and many of us want to keep track of what we do, as we can see by the rise of applications such as notes. Merging these two things together, this project will focus on meeting the needs of users who wish to keep track of what they have consumed across different forms of media and who also love to rank visual arts, literary pieces, graphic novels and much more.


## Example uses of the application
- As a user I want to be able to select a media category (such as movies, novels, anime) and input a single piece of media 
into it correctly (such as Inception, To Kill a Mockingbird, Haikyuu).
- As a user I want to create not only a media but also different media categories such as movies, novels, and anime under 
  which users can add specific media.
- As a user, I would want to rate different pieces of media based on a scale of 10. 
- As a user I want to order the added pieces of media based on their ratings, highest to lowest.
- - As a user, I want to see all the rankings ordered from the best to worst in a single place.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my data to a file. 
- As a user, I want to be able to load my data from a file.
